# Address-Book
The program maintains a record of people’s contact details including:
Name  
Phone Number  
Email  Address 
Users can add new contacts, search existing ones, edit details, delete records, and display all contacts through a user-friendly text menu.  All contact data is stored in a binary file so that information persists even after the program exits.
